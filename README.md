To open this project properly you will need Smooth Shake Pro, a tool I made
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/smooth-shake-pro-271080
(Simply install it into the Assets folder of the project)

And you need to have Blender installed, because the project uses blend files. 
Free and open source 3D software: https://www.blender.org/
